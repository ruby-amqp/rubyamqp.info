      About Ruby amqp gem
    %p
      Ruby amqp gem is a widely used, feature-rich, well-maintained, fast asynchronous AMQP 0.9.1 (RabbitMQ) Ruby client with batteries included.


    %h2 About AMQP 0.9.1
    %p
      AMQP is an open standard for messaging middleware that emphasizes interoperability between different technologies
      (for example, Java & JVM languages, .NET, Ruby, Python, Node.js, Erlang, C and so on).

    %p
      Key features of AMQP are very flexible yet simple routing and binary protocol efficiency. AMQP supports many sophisticated features, for example,
      message acknowledgements, returning of messages to producer, redelivery of messages that couldn't be processed, load balancing between message consumers and so on.
