h2. About this guide

This guide explains typical messaging patterns and use cases. It only covers the most common scenarios. For a comprehensive list of messaging patterns, consult books on this subject, for example, "Enterprise Integration Patterns":http://www.eaipatterns.com.

h2. Covered versions

This guide covers "Ruby amqp gem":http://github.com/ruby-amqp/amqp 0.8.0 and later.

h2. Introduction

Messaging patterns are a lot like object-oriented design patterns in that they are generalized reusable solutions to specific problems. They are not recipes, however, and their exact implementation may vary from application to application. Just like OO design patterns, they too can be classified:
 * Message construction patterns describe form, content and purpose of messages.
 * Message routing patterns outline how messages can be directed from producers to consumers.
 * Message transformation patterns change message content or metadata.
There are other, more specialized groups of messaging patterns that are out of the scope of this guide.
This guide demonstrates the implementation of several common routing patterns and also explains how built-in AMQP 0.9.1 features can be used to implement message construction and message transformation patterns.
Note that the guide is a work in progress. There are many messaging patterns and new variations are being discovered every year. This guide thus strives to be useful to the 80% of developers instead of being "complete".


h2. Request/Reply pattern

h3. Description and Use cases

Request/Reply is a simple way of integration when one application issues a request and another application responds to it. This pattern is often referred to as "Remote Procedure Call", even when it is not entirely correct. The Request/Reply pattern is a 1:1 communication pattern.
Some examples of the Request/Reply pattern are:
 * Application 1 requests a document that the Application 2 generates or loads and returns.
 * An end-user application issues a search request and another application returns the results.
 * One application requests a progress report from another application.

h3. AMQP-based implementation

Implementation of Request/Reply pattern on top of AMQP 0.9.1 involves two messages: a request (Req) and a response (Res). A client app generates a request identifier and sets the :message_id attribute on Req. The client also uses a server-named exclusive queue to receive replies and thus sets the :reply_to Req attribute to the name of that queue.

A server app uses a well-known queue name to receive requests and sets the :correlation_id to the :message_id of the original request message (Req) to make it possible for the client to identify which request a reply is for.

h4. Request message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:message_id</dt>
  <dd>Unique message identifier</dd>
  <dt>:reply_to</dt>
  <dd>Queue name server should send the response to</dd>
</dl>

h4. Response message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:correlation_id</dt>
  <dd>Identifier of the original request message (set to request's :correlation_id)</dd>
  <dt>:routing_key</dt>
  <dd>Client's replies queue name (set to request's :reply_to)</dd>
</dl>

h3. Code example

h4. Client code

{% gist 1207763 %}

h4. Server code

{% gist 1207764 %}

In the examples above messages are published with the :immediate attribute set. This is not necessary in all cases. Sometimes it is OK for requests to sit in the queue without active consumers. Replies, on the other hand, assume an active consumer and existing replies queue, so if routing or immediate delivery do not succeed, the server application will log returned messages. More on this in the "Working With Exchanges":/articles/working_with_exchanges/ guide.

h3. Related patterns

Request/Reply demonstrates two common techniques that are sometimes referred to as messaging patterns of its own:

  * "Correlation Identifier":http://www.eaipatterns.com/CorrelationIdentifier.html (for identifying what request incoming response is for)
  * "Return Address":http://www.eaipatterns.com/ReturnAddress.html (for identifying where replies should be sent)

Other related patterns are
  * Scatter/Gather
  * Smart Proxy

h2. Command pattern

h3. Description and Use cases

The Command pattern is very similar to Request/Reply, except that there is no reply and messages are typed. For example, most modern Web applications have at least one "background task processor" that carries out a number of operations asynchronously, without sending any responses back. The Command pattern usually assumes 1:1 communication.

Some specific examples of the Command pattern are:

 * Account termination in a Web app triggers information archiving (or deletion) that is done by a separate app "in the background".
 * After a document or profile update, a Web app sends out commands to a search indexer application.
 * Virtual machines control dashboard app sends virtual machine controller application a command to reboot.

h3. AMQP-based implementation

Implementation of the Command pattern on top of AMQP 0.9.1 involves well-known durable queues. The application that issues the command then can use the default exchange to publish messages to well-known services directly. The Request message :type attribute then indicates the command type and the message body (or body and headers) carry any additional information that the consumer needs to carry out the command.

h4. Request message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:type</dt>
  <dd>Message type as a string. For example: gems.install or commands.shutdown</dd>
</dl>

h3. Related patterns

 * Event
 * Request/Reply

h2. Event pattern

h3. Description and Use cases

The Event pattern is a version of the Command pattern, but with one or more receivers (1:N communication). The world we live in is full of events, so applications of this pattern are endless.

Some specific use cases of the Event pattern are

  * Event logging (one application asks an event collector to record certain events and possibly take action)
  * Event propagation in MMO games
  * Live sport score updates
  * Various "push notifications" for mobile applications

The Event pattern is very similar to the Command pattern, however, there are typically certain differences between the two:

  * Event listeners often do not respond to event producers
  * Event listeners are often concerned with data collection: they update counters, persist event information and so on
  * There may be more than one event listener in the system. Commands are often carried out by one particular application

h3. AMQP-based implementation

Because the Event pattern is a 1:N communication pattern, it typically uses a fanout exchange. Event listeners then use server-named exclusive queues all bound to that exchange. Event messages use the :type message attribute to indicate the event type and the message body (plus, possibly, message headers) to pass event context information.

h4. Request message attributes

<dl>
  <dt>:type</dt>
  <dd>Message type as a string. For example: files.created, files.indexed or pages.viewed</dd>
</dl>
<span class="note">Due to misconfiguration or different upgrade time/policy, applications may receive events that they do not know how to handle. It is important for developers to handle such cases, otherwise it is likely that consumers will crash.</span>

More on fanout exchange type in the "Working With Exchanges":/articles/working_with_exchanges/ guide.

  * Command
  * Publish/Subscribe

h2. Document Message pattern

h3. Description and Use cases

The Document Message pattern is very similar to the Command and Event patterns. The difference is in the intent. A Command message tells the receiver to invoke certain behavior, whereas a Document Message just passes data and lets the receiver decide what to do with the data.

The message payload is a single logical entity, for example, one (or a group of closely related) database rows or documents.

Use cases for the Document Message pattern often have something to do with processing of documents:

  * Indexing
  * Archiving
  * Content extraction
  * Transformation (translation, transcoding and so on) of document data


h2. Competing Consumers pattern

h3. Description and Use cases

"Competing Consumers":http://www.eaipatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html are multiple consumers that process messages from a shared queue.
